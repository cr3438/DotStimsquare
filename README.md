# DotStimsquare
A modified Random Dot Motion (RDM) task, built on Caitlin Lloyd's original experiment.
It is designed to measure motion perception and decision-making speed while presenting vertically moving dot fields.
# Modifications 
For the field shape I changed from 'circle' to 'square' so the dot field fills the entire screen. n/
Change from left/right (0, 180) to up/down (90, 270) for vertical motion perception.
Increased number of dots to from 150 to 2000 to have a clearer coherence.
I made the dots move more clearly and obvious by using high coherence levels [0.8, 0.8, 1.0, 1.0], so itâ€™s easier to see the up or down motion.
